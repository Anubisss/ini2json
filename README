   ini2json is a simple converter written in C++. It can convert an INI file
to a JSON file.

~ COMPILATION ~
   If you want to compile ini2json from the source code
you have to generate the project files for your compiler with CMake.
   CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) is an extensible, open-source
system that manages the build process in an operating system
and in a compiler-independent manner. You can download a GUI
for your Windows OS and generate project files for example
your Visual Studio.
